Assignment 1: Goroutine with Channel Problem: Write a Go program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N concurrently using goroutines and channels. The program should take the value of N as input from the user.

Assignment 2: Producer-Consumer with Channel Problem: Implement the producer-consumer problem using goroutines and channels. The producer should generate numbers from 1 to 100 and send them to a channel, and the consumer should print those numbers.

Assignment 3: Mutex for Synchronization Problem: Write a Go program that uses mutexes to synchronize access to a shared variable. Multiple goroutines should increment the variable concurrently, and the final value should be printed.

Assignment 4: Goroutine with Timeout Problem: Write a Go program that performs a task in a goroutine and waits for it to finish. However, if the task takes more than 3 seconds, the program should print a timeout message and exit.

Assignment 5: Pipeline Pattern Problem: Implement a pipeline pattern in Go where one goroutine generates numbers, another squares them, and a third prints the squared numbers.
